# Pluto for Channels

This simple Docker image will generate an M3U playlist and EPG optimized for use in [Channels](https://getchannels.com) and expose them over HTTP.

[Channels](https://getchannels.com) supports [custom channels](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/custom-channels/) by utilizing streaming sources via M3U playlists.

[Channels](https://getchannels.com) allows for [additional extended metadata tags](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/custom-channels/#channels-extensions) in M3U playlists that allow you to give it extra information and art to make the experience better. This project adds those extra tags to make things look great in Channels.
